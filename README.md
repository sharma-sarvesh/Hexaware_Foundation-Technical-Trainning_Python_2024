# Python Foundation Training - Batch 3

Welcome to my Python Foundation Training repository! This repository contains all my work and projects completed during the Foundation Technical Training on Python language, conducted from September 24 to October 24, 2024. The training focused on a variety of topics, including problem-solving techniques, data structures, databases, and full-stack development concepts using Python and SQL.

## Repository Structure

- **Assignments**: 
  - `Assignments.sql`: SQL assignments covering queries, data manipulation, and database design.
  - `task.py`: Python tasks that implement control structures, functions, and OOP principles.

- **CaseStudy_DigitalAssetManagementApplication**:
  - All files related to the Digital Asset Management Application project, including the Python codebase and SQL database schema.

- **Code**:
  - Contains all code snippets and programs executed during the training sessions. These include examples on data structures, algorithms, and Python best practices.

- **Coding Assessments & Evaluation**:
  - **PetPals Database Challenge**: A SQL project involving complex queries and database management.
  - **Hospital Management System**: A Python-based project implementing concepts like OOP, exception handling, and database connectivity.

- **TRAINNING_SUMMARY.md**:
  - A detailed summary of the entire training, including key topics, techniques, and projects completed.

## Training Overview

The training provided a solid foundation in Python programming, problem-solving techniques, and database management. It also included hands-on projects, case studies, and coding challenges to reinforce learning.

### Key Topics Covered:
- **Problem-Solving Techniques**: Algorithm basics, greedy approach, divide and conquer, dynamic programming, etc.
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and sorting/searching algorithms.
- **Agile & Scrum**: Understanding Agile methodologies and using tools like TRELLO.
- **MS SQL Server**: Database design, normalization, DML/DDL statements, and querying techniques.
- **Python Programming**: Data types, control structures, functions, OOP concepts, file handling, exception handling, and more.
- **Testing & Best Practices**: PyUnit testing, code optimization, and following PEP 8 standards.
- **Cloud Basics**: Introduction to AWS and Azure.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to explore the code and projects to understand the concepts covered during the training. You can use the examples and assignments as a reference for your own projects or to practice the techniques and best practices in Python and SQL.
